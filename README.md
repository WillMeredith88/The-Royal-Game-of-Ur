Once you have the application running, select the instructions button to read a description of how to play the game.
There is also a brief demo that you can use to see some basic game play.  The moves in the demo are hard-coded and we've removed 
a lot of the extra UI components to allow the user to focus only on the necessary information to play the game. 
All of the extras such as pictures of the dice roll are in the main game and working

Brief overview of functionality:

The game is fully functional and all features are working.

To start the game you will click the PlayerRoll button. Based on the value of the dice, the tokens that you may move will be highlighted green. If you happen to move onto one of the three rossettes (there are 5 but you can only land on 3 of them), you will get to roll again. Your goal is to get all of your tokens to the other side and off the board before your opponent.

Enjoy.
